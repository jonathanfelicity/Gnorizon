# Gnorizon Consults:
## Appraisal for entry level developers
### Background:
The Computer Science Department has a problem, it has been unable to send results out to students due to the ASUU strike. And students need their results to allow them to apply for scholarships before the next semester.

Students are not in Jos and it would be a hard and expensive task to send hard copy results to all their respective locations

You are a developer with a Gnorizon Consults and you are required to build a solution that will help solve this particular issue.

The department need a system to be able to allow itâ€™s lecturers to upload (excel) results of every student in the department as well as manage the students and every student to be able to login to their secured private account, view their results and also see their personal profile.

The head of department also wishes to be responsible for adding staff to the system and managing them as well.
In cases where the students or any user forgets their login details they will need to sort it out themselves as the department is closed for physical visits.
